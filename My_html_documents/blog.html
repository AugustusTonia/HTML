<p>The maritime industry includes all enterprises engaged in the business of designing, constructing, manufacturing, operating, supplying, repairing etc. in other to arrive at an increasing demand for the daily services it provides, the propulsion system must be given utmost attention as it is the powerhouse of every vessel. Without the propulsion system, the utility of a marine vessel will be of little or no importance. This project concentrates on the correct matching point in which the case study vessel should operate on. The methods used to achieve an optimal matching point include: The frictional resistance coefficient, in accordance with the ITTC-57 formula in calculating the ship total resistance, determining the engine power and the propeller requirements. The result gotten from the calculation will determine the matching point for the case study passenger vessel and this was more easily achieved by the use of (MATLAB). With the correct matching point, excessive fuel consumption and overloading of the prime movers is eliminated. For different kinds of ships, the power needed to maintain constant ship speed varies with different optimum propeller design rpm. Finding the most economical and reasonable matching point between engine and propeller on the constant ship speed curve in the layout area therefore becomes a matter of some importance. The effect of the magnitude of the power margin upon energy savings for the selected engine and propeller is also dealt with.</p>
